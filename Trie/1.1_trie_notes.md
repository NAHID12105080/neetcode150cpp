# Trie in C++ for Competitive Programming and DSA

## What is a Trie?

- A **Trie** (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure for storing strings efficiently.
- Stores words by their **prefixes**, enabling fast operations.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Prefix Search**: Insert/Search/Delete operations are fast.
- **Space Optimized**: Shares common prefixes among strings.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Insert: `O(L)` where `L` is the length of the string.
  - Search: `O(L)`.
  - Delete: `O(L)`.

## Use Cases

- Autocomplete systems.
- Spell checkers.
- Dictionary implementations.
- Longest prefix matching (e.g., IP routing).
