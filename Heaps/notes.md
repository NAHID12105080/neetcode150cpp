- **Priority Queue**: A data structure that stores elements such that the highest (or lowest) priority element is accessible in constant time.
- **Heap**: A specialized binary tree-based structure satisfying the heap property:
  - **Max-Heap**: Parent node â‰¥ child nodes.
  - **Min-Heap**: Parent node â‰¤ child nodes.
